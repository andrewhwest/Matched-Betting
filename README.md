# Matched betting  
A spreadsheet/dataframe to keep track of matched betting

## Matched-Betting explained
Matched betting is a risk-free betting technique that uses free bets offered by bookmakers to place bets that will always make a profit.  
  
Suppose we place 2 bets on a football game.   
1. Real Madrid to win  
2. Real Madrid not to win (draw or lose)  
  
One of these bets is guaranteed to win but bookmakers set the odds so that we will make a loss overall, regardless of which bet wins. 
  
With matched betting, we place these two bets but the first bet is placed using a free bet.   
There are two possible scenarios:  
  
1. Our free bet wins and we lose some money on the second bet  
2. The second bet wins and we lose no money from the free bet  
  
Scenario 1: A calculation is made so that the free bet wins more money than the second bet loses, ensuring that we make a profit.  
Scenario 2: We make a profit as no money is lost.  
  
What's the catch?  
Matched betting is time consuming and can be hard to keep track of when you're placing multiple bets per day.
  

## Motivation for project
I originally intended to find a way to collect odds from bookmakers and create a calculator to determine which events to bet on and how much to bet.  
  
However, it turns out that there are already several websites that do an excellent job of this.  
  
Instead the main aims of this project are to: 
  
•Keep track of bets and account balances  
•Automate as much as possible, the process of updating my spreadsheet with new bets  
•Have a clear and well organised spreadsheet that can be used for future data analysis  
  
## To do
1. <s>Make a new spreadsheet from the two existing ones</s>
2. <s>Add in some missing bets</s>  
3. <s>Add profit features to spreadsheet</s>  
4. Update spreadsheet with new bets  
5. Try to automate as much as possible, several daily tasks that keep track of bets
